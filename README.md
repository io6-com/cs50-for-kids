# 前言 Foreword

本教程受到哈佛大学CS50公开课\([https://cs50.harvard.edu](https://cs50.harvard.edu)\)的启发，用小朋友能理解的语言，跟小朋友一起聊聊计算机科学和编程。通过交互式的环境，使用Python语言，帮助小朋友具备一定的编程思维。

This course is inspired by Harvard University's CS50\([https://cs50.harvard.edu](https://cs50.harvard.edu)\). It uses the language children can understand to talk about computer science and coding. It aims  to help children to think like a computer scientist using Python programming language in an interactive environment.

开始学习编程最好的方式就是自己动手一行行敲代码。通常，编程环境的安装，会让小朋友，甚至家长兴趣降低一半。所以本教程采用先进的云环境，一边学习，一边敲代码练习，所有操作在浏览器就可以完成。无论是Windows，Chromebook，苹果，还是Linux电脑，无需任何安装。

The best way to learn how to code is to type line by line. Usually, the programming environment's setup makes children, even their parents frustrated. This course uses an advanced cloud environment via web browsers. No matter if you're using Windows, Chromebook, Apple, or a Linux computer, no single installation is needed.

本书主要是写给我刚满9岁的儿子看的。同时也希望本教程能给不懂编程的父母讲懂编程，享受亲子编程的快乐。和大多数人一样，我儿子通常会跳过每本书的前言部分，所以我们进入正题吧。

This course was initially written for my 9-year old son. The author also hopes that it could guide parents with zero knowledge of coding to understand Python and have the family fun in coding. Like the majority of people, my son skips the forward in most of the books. So let's get started.
